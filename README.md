# Bacterial Bioanalysis

The purpose of this assigment is to help  Roza to complete the panel for demographic information and to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel. Our results can be found in the following webpage https://gotica462.github.io/plotlydiploy/
